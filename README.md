# A repo for trajectory calculation and plot
* Jetbot can 'move' forward, left, right at a time 
* At each step, the Jetbot turn to the right angle and move forward in that direction
* Using Astar to find paths after each step
# JetbotPy is a file for Jetbot class 
* movement stuff is added and can be modified 
* Since the movement of the real jetbot is not accurate, we also used inaccurate motions for calculation
# Run the Tesing.py file. 
* The position of the jetbot can be calculated 
* The trajectory of the jetbot including position and heading can be printed and plotted
